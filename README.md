Codebase for Challenge 2 of the UNO IT Innovation Cup

## Hardware 
Raspberry Pi Pico W & Waveshare Pico ePaper 2.13

## Problem Statement
These days, children are starting to turn to social media for entertainment, leading to a day-to-day loss in motivation and curiosity. With our Raspberry Pi Pico W, E-ink display and our knowledge of Python, we developed an innovative solution.

By connecting to any power source with a micro-usb cable, our device keeps the proper time, refreshing every hour with new information. 
Its screen displays a variety of useful knowledge, including tech facts, new vocabulary, and book recommendationsâ€¦ It can even be used to schedule breaks, or start the morning off with a motivational quote. By refreshing each hour, it is able to build a strong foundation of knowledge one piece at a time, keeping kids curious throughout the day.

Our device has the potential to be built further upon. -  Using a more powerful Raspberry Pi and larger displays, it would become far smarter and more accessible to kids, ensuring that their interest and curiosity never wane.
